## Introduction
The OCR - TRANSLATOR System is designed to read text from images, recognize and translate it into multiple languages. The project integrates various libraries and APIs to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in text extraction and translation.
## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:** Enhances image quality for better OCR performance using OpenCV.
- **Text Extraction:** Utilizes Pytesseract for character recognition with CNNs and LSTM networks.
- **Multilingual Translation:** Supports translation into multiple languages using Googletrans.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and view results using Tkinter.
## Technologies Used
1. **OpenCV:** Used for image preprocessing tasks such as noise reduction, thresholding, and edge detection.
2. **Pytesseract:** A Python wrapper for the Tesseract-OCR Engine, leveraging CNNs and LSTM networks for text recognition.
3. **Googletrans:** A Python API for Google Translate, using sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms for accurate translation.
4. **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** Used for basic image handling tasks like loading, converting, and resizing images.
5. **Tkinter:** A standard Python interface for creating graphical user interfaces.
## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashutoshbehera07-tech/OCR---TRANSLATOR.git
   cd OCR - TRANSLATOR-Sytem
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Download and install Tesseract-OCR:**
   - For Windows: Download the installer from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - For macOS: Use Homebrew to install Tesseract:
     ```bash
     brew install tesseract
     ```
   - For Linux: Use the package manager to install Tesseract:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
     ```
## Usage
1. **Run the GUI application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Use the interface:**
   - Click on the desired language user want to tranlate the text.
   - Click on the "Browse Image" button to select an image file.
   - The system will display the Image with both extracted text and its translation.
