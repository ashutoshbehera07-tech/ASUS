## Introduction
The OCR-TRANSLATOR System is designed to read text from images, recognize and translate it into multiple languages. The project integrates various libraries and APIs to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in text extraction and translation.

## Features
*Image Preprocessing: Enhances image quality for better OCR performance using OpenCV.
*Text Extraction: Utilizes Pytesseract for character recognition with CNNs and LSTM networks.
*Translation: Supports translation into multiple languages using Googletrans.
*User-Friendly GUI: Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and view results using Tkinter.

## Technologies Used
*OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing tasks such as noise reduction, thresholding, and edge detection.
*Pytesseract: A Python wrapper for the Tesseract-OCR Engine, leveraging CNNs and LSTM networks for text recognition.
*Googletrans: A Python API for Google Translate, using sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms for accurate translation.
*PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for basic image handling tasks like loading, converting, and resizing images.
*Tkinter: A standard Python interface for creating graphical user interfaces.
